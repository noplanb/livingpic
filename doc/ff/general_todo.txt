Supporting connectivity issues:
- taking and posting photos:
 - log the photo params and upload later.  We should include tags, etc.
- logging errors
 - autoload when connectivity is restored
- monitors
 - none
- registration
 - save and try again later
- logging page changes?

We can try to create a method that is essentially ajax, but adds the following:
  - retries: 0, count, or nil (meaning infinite?)
  - error_message: indicates the error message to display if there is a problem
  - if it's drop, then we need to queue the params and the function, then try again later

x Get the session stuff working
 x Remember me should never expire as we want app to be cookied for ever and dealing with forgetting who the device is will probably not be well handled or a pleasant experience for the user.
 x Get current_user working.
 x My stubs for app registration are in app_controller. They should really be moved into user_controller. However app is where I keep all the preloaded views for the entire app and because they call the app with various registration scenarios for testing I put them in there.
 
x Architect and build out the backend for notification etc. 
- Error handler on client reports back to the server all errors.
