Normal fresh start:
  device_ready
  UserHandler.startup()

Hit home, then hit app again (or double-tap, go to another app, then back to LP):
  Resume


Hit home, cick safari, go to page that shows snapshot://u=7, click on the link
- livingpic launches but is blocked.  I close it, then restart it and I get the windowHandleUrl() 
  and 2 resume events.

- close livingpic in the bottom drawer so it's not resident, cick safari, go to page that shows snapshot://u=7, click on the link
  - device_ready
  - UserHandler


Searching on the web, found ways of correcting both issues:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8204308/phonegap-custom-url-handling-freezing
and 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12515096/how-do-i-handle-a-custom-url-scheme-in-phonegap-for-a-cold-start

the first introduces a delay so that the webview is visible.
The second introduces a way to always call window.handleOpenURL() when the app is sleeping.
