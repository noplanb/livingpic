Generated the Push notification certificate per http://www.pushwoosh.com/programming-push-notification/iphone-configuration-guide/
with password st@tor@m@123

In the process had to create a new app id for snapshot with the bundle ID com.noplanbees.snapshot

To get the push registration working I had to make sure I had done all of the following:
- IOS portal/App IDs: Create the appID with the right bundle name (com.noplanbees.snapshot) and make sure it is configured with APN set
- IOS portal/App IDs: Download the PUSH SSL certificate from (aps_development.cer)
- Double-click aps_development.cer to make sure it's registered in keychain
- IOS portal/Provisioning: Create a provisioning profile for that app and my phone, and download.  In my case it's called "FF_iPhone_4S_snapshot_.mobileprovision"
- Drop FF_iPhone_4S_snapshot_.mobileprovision into xcode.  double check in Organizer/Library to make sure it's there both in general and for my device

So now the registration seems to work, but the push still doesn't work from pushwhoosh

At pushwhoosh I had to enter the Application Code into what is called the appid in the javascript and then it works.

The pushwhoosh interface does not allow me to send a message to a particular customer.  If I want to do that, then I need to use their API.  I can also use their API for registration.
