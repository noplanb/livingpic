Creating sample data.  Things that I am intereseted in checking:
- Users and occasions that are around the same place
  - Need to have a set of canned locations that I use, and then create the users to be very close
    to those locations
x Contact records
- A-priori invitations should have been created
x Dozens of photos, with appropriate mixed data such as
  x taker
  x tagging
  x occasions
