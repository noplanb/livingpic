<2c a message but couldn't sign up

redrabbit.com
about $0.05/message and based in europe. Doesn't seem to support http (although I read it did).  Extremely lame website

www.aerialink.com/
Too much verbiage on the website but nothing useful.  Couldn't figure out what product I would be using or what the price point would be for it.

openmarket.com 
seems to have an http api and support the services we want, but it doesn't seem to have a reasonable API

twilio.com
has the nicest website and 1c/message
