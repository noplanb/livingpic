Tests on Android:
in livingpic.test
Uninstall App
Comment out PushHandler.init()
Run from Eclipse
AndroidManifest.xml intent filter for Pushwoosh commented out
** Webintent Works

Uncommented PushHandler.init() in application.js in the livingpic.test
Did not resinstall app
Just build w/ eclipse
** Webintent Works

Clean, but did not reinstall App
** Webintent doesn't work

Run it again 
** webintent works on the second try (have breakpoints)

Now testing with the CLI build.  Deleted the app on the device.  Uncommented that intent-filter lines I had commented out in the manifest
** This time it worked on the third try

Moved PushHandler.init() after Boot.initialize() in the deviceready sequence and rebuilt using CLI. Did NOT reinstall.
** Worked on the 4th try

Now moved the PushHandler.init() to be after the webintent call in the boot sequence.  Now it works!!!

Now the problem is that the message doesn't show in the notification:  Putting a display of the notificaiton message in PushHandler notification event handler I see:

06-03 18:04:37.096: D/CordovaLog(13126): Notification = {"message":"Someone just added photos to the 'test_ff' album","foregroud":false,"collapse_key":"do_not_collapse","from":"926360415491","onStart":true,"custom":"{\"c\":606}"}

The message is clearly OK, but it does not show.

Android push notification

adb -d logcat

Can pass the sound in the notification message.  Set it to "default" for default.
the token ID can change each time, so need to update the token with the device each time.
