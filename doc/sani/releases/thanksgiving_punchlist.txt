Punchlist for thanksgiving alpha in order of importance.

 ] Server
   - Get it working on the server even in dev mode would be ok if production gives us problems with assets.

 ] App install
   - Ability to manually get the app on friends phones. 
   - iphone 
     - Ideally texting a link.
     - Also would work:
       - Connecting phone to mac with cable (need to get that working on sanis machine as well though)
     - Need to recall how to register devices.
   - Android texting a link and manually setting the phone to download 3rd party apps.
 
 ] - User registration.
     - Get the flow to work.
     - Manual work around? 
     - We need to get it so that if users in our little group are invited as participants in an occasion the occasion automatically comes up for them.
