Bugs
---------
  x Jills phone got stuck while I clicked done in ftui when it asked who else I know at the occasion. Same on Sani Galaxy.
    x Need to also incorporate a skip here.
  x When you come in from a link to a photo newly added by someone else it shows you the photo but when you click back to the album it is not there.
  x Photos taken on iphone and jills phone come in sideways then are fixed by the server.
  x Create a fresh user no invite. Dont create album in Ftui. Snap picture. Try to save in a new album. Javascript error current_occasion(...).is_new_record is not a function 
  - !! Take photo on nexus, doesnt save until you exit app and resume. causing - Photos disappear from gallery.
  
  
 
User Feedback
-------------
 x New Album button top right of albums.
 - Trim android and iphone permissions to only what we need.
 x Add caption then change album removes the entry you made in the caption.
 o Wording
   o Are you at album doesnt make sense in some cases during sign up ftui.
   o People at album doesnt make sense in add people
 x When you come in to see a picture from a link it should make that album is now your current occasion.
 - Wording on adding new participants in ftui for brand new invitee.
 - Link to comment should go to comment rather than to photo.
 
Process
-------
 - Get iphone on cordova2.3


Tests
-----
 - Clear state on browser.
 - Create a new user on the browser
 - Create an album and invite sani
 - Add a photo
 
 
Iphone bullshit:
---------------
 x Change to startup_confirmation to check cookies confirmation.

 x Flow:
- Message handler called with no context id
-> UserHandler.startup called with no opts
-> UserHandler.startup does not find current user
-> UserHandler.startup calls check_cookies_confirmation for iphone and just does check cookies for android.
-> Check cookies confirmation button checks_cookies for iphone.
-> Check cookies redirects back to app with c="" I believe since there is no notification id in the session for this unrecongized user
-> Message handler starts all in the same state as in first step of this.
