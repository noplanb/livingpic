   - To prevent freezing on a page with no ui when we get a javascript error. Do go_home if we catch an error on the release version.
  
  - TWEAKS
    - Get rid of gallery button and put it on pick from gallery page.
    - Turn off autocorrect when entering names.
    - Says new photos when it is really new comments.
    - Alerts say index.html rather than livingpic.
    
  - PERFORMANCE (all post release)
    - Clicking from occasions page is slow. 
    - Profile startup to minimize time
    - Lag between confirming the occasion and showing it in the gallery handler is too long.
      - Too much seems to be happening syncing gallery etc...
    x Capture button needs to have an instantaneous response of some sort.
    - Remove all unused javascript and html css
    - Streamline startup to minimize latency to current gallery from boot

    - Show upload status in gallery.
    - Streamlined version of jquery.
    - FF Aesthetics
      - Still don't care for the "save in ..." when a photo has been taken.  The buttons aren't aligned.  
      - Don't care for comment window - by erasing the photo it puts you out of context - the experience is jarring for me.  Would be better to open it right there underneath the photo...
    - Refactor
      - rename all the xx2 stuff back to xx
    - Aditya
       - Grey border around pencil
    - Eliminate gallery picker icon from header. Camera goes to gallery picker and there is an option to snap a pic from there in the footer.
    - Android photo to be uploaded is too large.
    - Remove testpages from store release build
    - Add pulldown refresh to the occasions page.
    - Panoramic photos in picker, occasion for pic, gallery2
    - Zoom with a certain orientation causes photo to do a 270deg spin.
    - Weird light blue line at top of header in iphone and android.
    - Flash Notice no longer works because not using mobile.changePage
    - Clean up deprecated in package_app.rake

    - Eva android cant zoom locally taken pic. It is too big.
    - Android display gallery shows the people page first.
    - Debounce Done button on gallery picker.
    - Android very large photos take a long time to upload on new phones
    - If you add a coption in gallerypicker it should add it to the list.
    - Ios 7 gap at top and bottom of page sometimes grows for each photo you add.
    - Touch points in header are too small still on ios
    - When you are out of connectivity and it tries to load a picture from the web it shows a broken link. We should probably change to the model of only showing photos in that have already been downloaded.
    - Gallery picker zoom sometimes removes the edit and check buttons.
    - Order albums by date of the last post
