Farhad
  - Android Something is blocking when there is poor connectivity causing no device ready and error on android.
    - Sani and Jills phone android loading html page error cordova popup!
  - Iphone slows down seemingly swapping memory.
  - Enhance noifications
    - Add comment text to notsification.
    - Add photo to notification.
  - Queue comments and invites.
    - Queue comments so UI is instant even in no connectivity.
    - Queue invites so the UI is instant even in no connectivity.
    - Allow comments to be added to a brand new photo before it goes to the server - More difficult
  - Invite takes 6 seconds.
  - Figure out why use strict in fastclick breaks ajax calls and put strict back in.
  - Put passing push token in user handler and take it out of boot since the user may not be known at boot.
  - Background the paperclip tasks on photo create.
  - Iphone store loads old version then presents an update button.
  - Bug when you click on a photo notificaiton when the occasion isn't loaded yet
  - Add a request id to the log file
  
  
Sani
  - FTUI for ad hoc user make more streamlined a la FTUI for invited userf
  - Remove unused pages in the ftui - invite, enter other occasion etc
  - Splunk
  - Remove all stuff associate with iphone store release
  
Bugs
  - Make the check_cookies page and landing page not cacheable by the browser.
  o Invited rick but it wouldnt take because he did not let the landing page fully load before clicking off.
  - Livingpic version = undefined version on compile assets.
  - Bug with broken photo not uploading on android phone 
  - Bug When you add a new album it temporarily puts it at the bottom of the list.
    - can't replicate it
  - Checkin goes into infinite loop if checkin fails to find user on the server.
  - Also save pics to gallery on android
  

Enhancements
  - When a new user shows a big gallery for the first time prepare_for_display blocks the gallery rendering
  - Slow start-up is there anything we can do.
  - Slow scroll is there anything we can do.
  - If phone number is incorrect provide notice to inviter and a method of changing it.
  - Ambiguity
    - When you check in to see if there is something new. We always show the old gallery first. We should let you know that it is bringing in new photos.
      - In the gallery indicate somehow that photos are uploading. 
    - When you have multiple new comments since you last visited you dont know which photos they are on.
  - Ftui dont ask for current location right away. - Iphone only
  - Pinch on the photos.
  - Real photoswipe with fullbleed photos in pic detail.
  - Allow entry of adhoc contacts for invite.
  - Make the loading page interesting. 
  - Migrate to latest cordova.
  
  
Punt  
  o Register page submit to server is really slow.
    - Investigation shows that it takes 5 seconds to do a occasions_json on the server due to lots of db calls. Just live with long spinner as this is a one time occurrence during registration. 
  o Android pictures sometimes dont upload.
    
  o Apple photostream nice experience copy it.
    - Sani and Farhad need to discuss what this means
      - Immediate appearance after click of notification.
      - Full bleed of photo
      - Comment or like displayed immediate.
