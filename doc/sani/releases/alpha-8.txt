Bugs

  - Livingpic version = undefined version on compile assets.
  - Bug with broken photo not uploading on android phone

  - Version update notice to users if they are using an out of date app.
  - Slow start-up is there anything we can do.
  - Slow scroll is there anything we can do.
  - If phone number is incorrect provide notice to inviter and a method of changing it.
  - Ambiguity
    - When you check in to see if there is something new. We always show the old gallery first. We should let you know that it is bringing in new photos.
      - In the gallery indicate somehow that photos are uploading. 
    - When you have multiple new comments since you last visited you dont know which photos they are on.
  - Pushwoosh plugin for cordova for android.
  - Ftui dont ask for current location right away. - Iphone only
  - Ftui dont ask for contacts right away. - Iphone only
  - Pinch on the photos.
  - Real photoswipe with fullbleed photos in pic detail.
  - Allow entry of adhoc contacts for invite.
  - Make the loading page interesting. 
  - Migrate to latest cordova.
  
  
Punt  
  o Register page submit to server is really slow.
    - Investigation shows that it takes 5 seconds to do a occasions_json on the server due to lots of db calls. Just live with long spinner as this is a one time occurrence during registration. 
  o Android pictures sometimes dont upload.
    
  o Apple photostream nice experience copy it.
    - Sani and Farhad need to discuss what this means
      - Immediate appearance after click of notification.
      - Full bleed of photo
      - Comment or like displayed immediate.
