I learned from photoswipe a cleaner way to have an instance of a class refer to itself internally rather than passing in name_of_self when you instantiate it.

1) In the instance constructor optionally pass in an id for the instance. If one is not passed in then the instance creates its own id using timestamp for example. 

2) There exists separate object apart from the class that contains all instances created for this class reference by id.

3) The instance references this separate object to get at itself when it needs to.
