We need the ability to remove the latency on native phone browser clicks to eliminate the sluggishness of our app when clicking buttons etc.


USE FAST_CLICK.JS?
------------------
 - Tried using fast click. 
   - It feels like it is too heavy and general purpose. 
   - It tends to run a lot of code for each click.
   - I also had to patch it for the needs_click to work. 
   

A SIMPLER STRATEGY FOR OUR CASE
-------------------------------

  x STRATEGY
    x For javascript running on the phone add an event listener for touchstart
    x For javascript running on the browser add an event listener for click
    
  x IMPLEMENTATION
    x Add a field to the element called data-instaclick
    x The field contains the text of the javascript that should be attached to the touchstart or click event 
      depending on whether we are running in the browser.
    x On document ready find all elements with this field and attach the appropriate event handler.
  
  x TODO 
    x Create a test page
    
KEEP INSTACLICK AS WELL FOR SCROLLABLE PAGES.
---------------------------------------------
  - For now I have kept instaclick as well for scrollable pages like the occasions page. 
  - I am not happy with the click performance from that page but will keep for now.
