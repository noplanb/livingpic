PROBLEM: When we build with Cordova3.0 it created a new AndroidManifest.xml which eliminated some of the custom stuff we have put in the old AndroidManifest.xml.

SOLUTION: merge the two. 

PROCESS: 
  x Under vendor/cordova/android create a new AndroidManifest.xml.
  x For each line in the new file created by cordova and our own line determine how to merge.
  x Make package_app.rake copy the manifest over from our code base.
  

PROBLEM: Farhad's new package_app.rake doesn't set version etc for android builds in AndroidManifest.xml.

PROCESS: Make sure all the tasks in the old package_app.rake for android are running in the new package_app.rake.
  x TODO
    x versionName in Manifest.xml
    x versionCode in Manifext.xml
