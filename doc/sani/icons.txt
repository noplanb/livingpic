Notes for additya.
  - The lines and bullets on the list icon are just a hair too thick and heavy. Make them thinner. Try 4 instead of 3?
  - The plus sign doesnt feel right. 
    - Lets try a couple options.
      - Increase the thickness of the plus and reduce the thickness of the border.
      - Increase the thickness of the plus and eliminate the border.
  - I also need an X close in purple.
  - Edit pencil
    - I also need one that is white with a transparent background.
    - The icon is a just slightly thick. Can we make the border and the pencil drawing a bit thinner.
  - Check marks
    - The border circle is ok but the stroke for the check mark is a bit wide can we make it thinner.
