The following instructions on git are great. https://github.com/defunkt/resque

Here is what I did:

Install redis I used:

PREFIX='/usr/local' rake redis:install dtach:install
I found I had to use PREFIX=/usr/local since the rake task tries to put redis in usr/bin by default and I could not run the rake task under sudo to get permission for it to put it there.

To start redis is use
rake redis:start

To check the status of workers and queues go to: oursite/resque i.e. 127.0.0.1:3000/resque
