-------------------------------------- 

  QUESTION - What is the performance of $.mobile.chagePage() 
  TEST - run in profiler on Sani's Iphone
  RESULTS - 
    - From #occasions to #gallery2 using $.mobile.changePage() with no on change events of any kind running    
      callback application.js:8529
      64.07ms
    
      handle application.js:2746
      1.17s
    
      (anonymous function) application.js:13661
      0.07ms
      
      evaluate
      1.17s  *** This is the culprit.
      
    - Looking deeper in evaluate we see:
      changePage application.js:14442
      1.15s
    
    - Looking deeper in changePage we see: a jquery find() that takes 640ms and a jqm transitionPages() that takes 275ms
    
    
  QUESTION - what is the performance of a simple show and hide of the pages.
  TEST - run profiler on Sani's iphone
  RESULTS - From #occasions to #gallery using hide() and show() of the pages RESULTS - 10ms.
  
  
  STRATEGY
  --------
  Rather than trying to figure out how to improve the performance of JQM let us just make our own simple pager.
  
  Considerations on eliminating JQM
    x Changing pages adds classes to data-role page that control css 
      x On data-role page
        x ui-page 
        x ui-body-c 
        x ui-page-active
      x On body
        x ui-mobile
        x ui-mobile-viewport 
        x ui-overlay-a
    x Add css to mobile.css for pager
    x Create a class called page
    x Add the css from ui-page, ui-body-c, ui-page-active classes to the pager.css for page
    x Add a class for our body called mobile
      x Add css from ui-mobile, ui-mobile-viewport, ui-overlay-c to the pager.css for the body
  
  TODO:
    x Make the occasions2 page in our theme with a header
      x Header
      x Content
