USE brake app:build_android_release  #look for the signed LivingPic-release-signed_aligned.apk in the android/bin directory

Dev Console:
https://play.google.com/apps/publish


Manifest and permissions:
I edit the AndroidManifest.xml in the relevant cordova framework directory under app in order to trim the permissions. Need to remember to do that when migrating to a new cordova.

This command generates a new key but it only needs to be done once. 
app:generate_android_key 
it uses the following command:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

signing:
app:build_android_release should automatically sign with the correct key with the task app:sign_for_android_release
which uses this command:
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg MD5withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore my_application.apk alias_name


I have generated the following keys:
app/android_keys/livingpic_1.0.keystore
---------------------------------------
Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA1withRSA) with a validity of 20,000 days
