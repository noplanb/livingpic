How to handle connectivity issues and offline-ability?

First Store Release
-------------------
 - Possible User Experience:
   - The app must be connected in order to function properly. 
   - If the app is not connected then when the app needs to go to the server it puts up not-connected error page:
     - "Cannot reach www.livingpic.com. Please verify your Internet connection is working properly."
     - A try again button? For after you fix the problem takes you where? Boot.initialize? The home page for the first release app?
   - What if it failed on uploading a pic you captured? Too bad its lost.
   
 - Implementation: (If we are ok with the above experience how should we implement?)
   o Cordova provides a connection status? Check this before sending anything? Problem is that will not catch the error if our server is down.
   - For all $.ajax call a universal error handler on error that detects the not found error and puts up the error page?
     - Would need to find all of these and adjust them.
