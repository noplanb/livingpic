See the file gallery2_w_iphone_scroll.txt for initial information about the zoomer. I started this separate file later when the original file including the scroller got too long.

PROBLEM: 
  - On Iphone elements that are transformed to scale beyond the boundaries of their enclosing boxes do so without a problem as long as their enclosing boxes carry overflow visible.  
  - On Android (and Firefox) the transformed items cannot scale up above the pos(top) of or to the left of the pos(left) of a parent box even if overflow is set to visible.
  
SOLUTION:
  - Create a special zoom div that is absolutely positioned at the top left of the body.
  - When zooming img. 
    - Get the position width and height of the img.
    - Set the pos width and height of the zoom div to the same.
    - Load the image in the zoom div with width set to 100%
    - Zoom that image. 
  - The above method is what is used in the gallerypicker. We need to do the same for gallery2
  - Standardize the zoomer to do this.

TODO: 
   x Add #zoom_photo to the DOM
     x Move the zoom photo from gallery_picker.mobile to the top level under body peer with a page.
     x Move css for it to mobile.css.
     
   x Put the code from the GalleryPicker into the zoomer
     x Zoomer is passed the src of the photo to be zoomed so you can pass it the full hd pic.
     x Create a ZoomPhotoLoader
       x Sets the top, left and width of #zoom_photo based on the el which was passed to zoomer.
       x Sets the z-index
       x Loads the photo
     x Zoomer observes the load event on the #zoom_photo and continues with the snap.
     
   x Add zoom_photo handler
      x Add zoom_photo
