WEIRDNESS: 
  - Before when I run a query of all fullsize photos using a standalone test app i got  1136. 
  - Now using the same query on the same stand alone app i get 644.
  TRY - Reboot the phone - same.
  TRY - Catalog the bucket names I am seeing in the list of 644 vs the list of 1136 that I have saved from yesterday.
      - With todays query I see:
        photos=3, 
        Lillian lake=65, 
        WhatsApp Images=11, 
        100MEDIA=555, 
        Camera=3, 
        Screenshots=6, 
        sdcard0=1
      - From the data i have saved from yesterday I see:
        I see all the same except photos= 498.
  EXPLANATION: When I deleted the livingpic app it also deleted all of our photos.

  - How can I get the album names LivingPic Occasion_name to show up in my gallery?

QUESTION: How do I get photos and thumbnails in groups ordered by date added in reverse.
  - If I just search for thumbnails do I miss the photos that havent been converted yet?
  TRY 
    - snap a photo.
    - run the download of all fullsized photos
    - does it show up in the list? RESULT - It appears immediately.
  TRY
    - snap a photo
    - run the download of all thumbnails
    - does it show up on the list? RESULT - It appears immediately.

QUESTION: There is no date for the thumb table. Can you rely on descending image_id to sort by most recent first? RESULT - yes.

QUESTION: How long after I snap a photo is it available to a MediaStore query? RESULT - Immediately for both thumbs and photos see above.

STRATEGY:
  - Download a set of thumbs sorted by reverse IMAGE_ID
  - Show them in the gallery picker.
  - Zoom causes a call to get the large photo.
  - Save causes a call to get the large photos.

PROBLEM: 
  - The vast majority of thumbs have no large photo associated with them.

SOLUTION: 
  - I was doing it wrong. I need to do Thumbnails.getThumbnail first which blocks until one is created. Then I need to query for the thumb that was created.
  

EXPERIMENT:
  - Loop through all the images get the thumbs as well as the images. See how long it takes.
  - Test time delay on the Cordova side.
  
  - Time delays for getting photos and thumbs - 
    - Strategy: always call get thumb for each large photo:
    - Java time 
      - 1 - 34ms
      - 10 - 417ms
      - 20 - 1300ms
      - 50 - 2700ms
      - 100 - 4500ms
  
PROBLEM: 
  - Getting photos with thumbs is rather slow. 
  TRY - Make the gallery_picker continually pull small batches until all are loaded. Dont key off of whether user has scrolled to near end. 
  PROBLEM - Cordova runs our plugin code on the Webview Activity Thread. This essentially blocks all UI while it is running. 
  TRY - Put the plugin getPhotosWithThumbsCode on a background thread. 
      - Todo
        - Copy AlbumInterface.java

    x Album interface
    x All files in utils
    x Delete cursortojson and replace with cursor utils
  x Make a backup of android.
  x Run on phone with corova
  x Test all the methods. 
  x Do some perf testing.
